This language treats all variables as whole numbers, for simplicity. The program executes from top to bottom, and code functions are documented below

----- VARIABLES -----

ASSIGN X TO Y
The ASSIGN function will instantiate variable Y if needed, then set the value equal to X.

----- MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS -----

ADD X TO Y
The ADD function performs addition, incrementing Y by X.

ADD X TO Y INTO Z
If the ADD function is invoked with INTO, the result of the addition will be stored in Z instead of changing the value of Y.


SUBTRACT X FROM Y
The SUBTRACT function performs subtraction, decrementing Y by X.

SUBTRACT X FROM Y INTO Z
If the SUBTRACT function is invoked with INTO, the result of the subtraction will be stored in Z instead of changing the value of Y.


MULTIPLY X BY Y
The MULTIPLY function performs multiplication, multiplying X by Y.

MULTIPLY X BY Y INTO Z
If the MULTIPLY function is invoked with INTO, the result of the multiplication will be stored in Z instead of changing the value of X.


DIVIDE X BY Y
The DIVIDE function performs division, dividing X by Y.

DIVIDE X BY Y INTO Z
If the DIVIDE function is invoked with INTO, the result of the division will be stored in Z instead of changing the value of X.

----- CONDITIONAL BLOCKS -----

IF X IS Y
The IF function will begin a conditional code block that ends at the next RESUME function. IF X IS Y will enter the conditional block if the values of X and Y are equal.

IF X
If the IF function is invoked this way, it will enter the conditional block if the value of X is greater than 0, like a rudimentary boolean.

RESUME
The RESUME function marks the end of the the previous IF statement.

----- OTHER FUNCTIONS -----
	
WRITE X
The WRITE function will output the value of X to the console.
	
COMMENT This is a comment
The COMMENT function is for notes within the code. Any text on the line after the COMMENT function is ignored when executing.
