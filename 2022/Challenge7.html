                        <p>After your incredible work on tracking extraterrestrial life you were promoted to oversee an entire division uncover foreign spies.
                            Your team while talented needs your help.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You are working in SIGINT for an intelligence office in the federal government with top 
                            secret clearance.  One of your field operatives intercepted and recorded a radio signal 
                            being transmitted by a known sleeper agent working for a foreign government, and has 
                            securely transmitted the recording to your office.  You are tasked with reading the 
                            demodulated radio message to see what was transmitted.
                        </p>
                        <p> You already know the sleeper agent is not acting very carefully and therefore isn’t 
                            protecting their message using encryption; there will be no need to decrypt this 
                            message using some sort of cipher.
                            However, you have been informed the message intercepted is a digital transmission, 
                            and this is where you come in.  You have only been provided with the raw waveform 
                            recorded by your field operative’s radio receiver.  Therefore, you will need to 
                            demodulate this signal from a list of samples.</p>
                        <p> You have intel that indicates this sleeper 
                            agent has been using a digital transmitter that leverages Amplitude Phase Shift Keying 
                            (APSK) modulation (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_and_phase-
                            shift_keying).
                        </p>
                        <p> The field operative has sent a text file to you for you to demodulate using code.  This file 
                            is comprised of many samples of a single, full transmission that was intercepted.  
                            Individual lines of the file represent the signal intensity (amplitude) that the radio 
                            receiver read at that point in time, as human-readable floating point numbers.  Every 
                            group of 32 lines in the file are a collection of samples (floating point numbers) that 
                            become one symbol of the APSK signal transmitted.
                            Each symbol is a sine wave modulated in two manners: phase and amplitude.  A 
                            reference “carrier wave” to which the transmitted phase is calculated against is a sine 
                            wave, which completes its full period over 32 samples in the text file.
                        </p>
                        <p> An APSK symbol is comprised of two components:<br/>
                            1. The phase shift (offset) of the signal, the X axis
                            2. The amplitude of the signal, the Y axis
                            <br/>
                        <p> Phase can shift up to 50% of the waveform, so multiply the phase by two to get a value 
                            ranging from 0 (fully in phase) to 1 (180 degrees out of phase).
                            Amplitude does not need any scaling and can be treated as linear for the purposes of 
                            plotting on the Y axis from 0 (silent) to 1 (full volume).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Visible in the image above is a sine wave whose function abruptly changes at intervals 
                            of 32 samples.  Understanding the phase (X) and amplitude (Y) of the function at each 
                            interval is your task here.</p>
                        <p> Knowing the phase and amplitude for a given symbol, you are able to turn them into a 
                            corresponding X and Y value to translate them to a bitstream using a constellation.  The 
                            constellation is:
